# Build AI Platforms from Scratch - Code Repository

This repository contains common code patterns and utilities for building and iterating on AI platforms. It serves as a reference implementation for the "Build AI Platforms from Scratch" course.

## Overview

This is not a complete project, but rather a collection of reusable code patterns that demonstrate best practices for working with AI platforms across different technology stacks.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript with Vite
- **Backend**: Go with Gin framework
- **Mobile**: Flutter

## Code Patterns

This repository includes implementations for:

- **Token Tracking**: Tracking tokens for AI requests and responses
- **LLM API Integration**: Patterns for calling LLM APIs
- **Response Parsing**: Parsing specific types of AI responses while accounting for hallucinations
- And more common patterns for AI platform development

## Getting Started

See `setup-instructions.txt` for basic setup instructions for each technology stack.
